        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Just like Mama used to make! Nothing beats fresh pasta, and this simple semolina and egg recipe is the best thing ever. <br>
            You can use this recipe to make any style of pasta you like, from fettucine to ravioli to lasagna. Semolina is a special variety <br>
            of wheat flour available at health food stores and gourmet grocery stores.</p>
         <h2>Ingredints</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups semolina flour</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
         </ul>
         <ol>Directions to follow
            <li>Thoroughly sift together all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and pinch of salt. On a <br>
                clean surface, make a mountain out of flour mixture then make a deep well in center.<br>
                Break the eggs into the well and add olive oil. Whisk eggs very gently with a fork,<br>
                gradually incorporating flour from the sides of the well. When mixture becomes too<br>
                thick to mix with a fork, begin kneading with your hands.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Knead dough for 8 to 12 minutes, until it is smooth and supple. Dust dough and work <br>
                surface with semolina as needed to keep dough from becoming sticky. Wrap dough <br>
                tightly in plastic and allow it to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. </li>
                <br>
             <li> Roll out dough with a pasta machine or a rolling pin to desired thickness. Cut into<br>
                your favorite style of noodle or stuff with your favorite filling to make ravioli. Bring<br>
                water to a boil in a large pot, then add 4 teaspoons salt. Cook pasta until tender but<br>
                not mushy, 1 to 8 minutes depending on thickness. Drain immediately and toss with <br>
                your favorite sauce.</li>       
         </ol>
