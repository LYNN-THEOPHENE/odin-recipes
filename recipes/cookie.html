        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> <em> A very dark, rich chocolate cookie for the true chocoholic. This recipe uses relatively little flour,<br>
           resulting in dense, fudge-like cookies. These cookies keep well in the freezer <br>
           (but you may have a hard time waiting for them to thaw before you eat them)</em></p>
        <h2>Ingredints</h2>   
        <ul>
            <li>4 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>0.5 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>0.25 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>0.25 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions to follow</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt <br>
                 unsweetened chocolate,1 cup of the chocolate chips, and the butter stirring <br> 
                 occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. In a large bowl, <br> 
                 whip eggs and sugar until thick and pale, about 2 minutes. Stir in the vanilla and the <br> 
                 chocolate mixture until well mixed. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking powder and <br> 
                 salt; gradually stir into the chocolate mixture. Fold in remaining 1 cup chocolate chips. <br> 
                 Cover dough and chill for at least an hour or overnight.</li>
                 <br>

            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll chilled dough into 1 inch balls. <br> 
                Place on ungreased cookie sheets so they are 2 inches apart.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Bake for 9 to 11 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet <br> 
                for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
